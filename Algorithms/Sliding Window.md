# 1️⃣ What is the Sliding Window technique?
The Sliding Window technique is a problem-solving approach that involves maintaining a window or subarray of elements within a larger array. This window is adjusted or "slides" based on certain conditions, allowing efficient computation of desired results. The technique is often used for problems involving substring, subarray, or sliding range operations.

# 2️⃣ Why use the Sliding Window technique?
The Sliding Window technique offers an optimized solution for problems that require evaluating or finding patterns within a fixed-size window or subarray. By avoiding redundant computations and leveraging the overlapping nature of the window, it can significantly improve the time complexity of the algorithm.

# 3️⃣ How to use the Sliding Window technique?
Let's understand this technique by looking at the following example:

Problem: Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of a subarray with a fixed size k.

Example:

Input: nums = [4,2,1,7,8,1,2,8,1,0], k = 3

Output: 16

Explanation: The subarrays of size 3 are [4,2,1], [2,1,7], [1,7,8], [7,8,1], [8,1,2], [1,2,8], [2,8,1], [8,1,0]. The maximum sum among these subarrays is 16, which corresponds to [7,8,1].

In this problem, we have an array of integers and a fixed window size (k). We need to find the maximum sum of a subarray within the given array using a sliding window of size k. The window starts at the beginning of the array and slides through the array, calculating the sum of each subarray within the window. The maximum sum encountered is returned as the result. The sliding window technique allows us to efficiently compute the sum by removing the leftmost element of the window and adding the rightmost element in each iteration.

Using the Sliding Window technique, we can optimize the time complexity of the algorithm to O(n), providing an efficient solution compared to other approaches such as brute force.
