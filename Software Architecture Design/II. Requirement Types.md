# 1️⃣ Feature Requirements
---
1. Gathering Requirements
	1. Use Cases: Situation / Scenario in which our system is used
	2. User Flows: A Step by Step / Graphical representation of each use case
2. Requirement Gathering Steps
	1. Identify all the actors / users in our system
	2. Capture and describe all the possible use-cases /scenarios
	3. User Flow - Expand each use case through flow of events
		- Each event contains
			- Action
			- Data
3. Unified Modeling Language (UML) - Sequence Diagram
# 2️⃣ Quality Attribute 
---
1. Definition
	- Provide a quality measure on how well our system performs on a particular dimension
	- The have direct correlation with the architecture of our system
2. Important Considerations - Tradeoffs
	- No single software architecture can provide all the quality attributes
	- Certain quality attributes contradict one another
	- Some combinations of quality attributes are very hard / impossible to achieve
	- We (Software Architects) need to make the right <u>tradeoff</u>
3. Important Considerations - Feasibility
	- We need to make sure that the system is capable of delivering with the client asking for
	- The client may ask for something that is either
		- Technically impossible
		- Prohibitively expensive to implement
